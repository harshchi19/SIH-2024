  history:
    "Aryan Kumar, a 6-year-old male, exhibits delayed speech and language development. He began vocalizing at 6 months, but babbling was delayed until 12 months. His first word was spoken at 3 years, and his first sentence was formed at 4.5 years, although it lacked clarity. Aryan primarily communicates in Hindi at home, learns English at school, and occasionally speaks Bengali with relatives. He struggles with expressing emotions verbally, understanding complex instructions, and articulating certain vowel sounds, impacting his ability to communicate effectively in social and academic settings.",
  diagnosis:
    "Aryan has been diagnosed with a Speech and Language Disorder, primarily affecting his articulation and speech production. He exhibits delays in vowel articulation, though his consonant and blend articulation are adequate. His expressive language is limited, with difficulty forming clear sentences and a restricted vocabulary. Additionally, Aryan struggles with receptive language, particularly in understanding multi-step instructions. His speech is also impacted by suprasegmental issues, including flat intonation, incorrect stress patterns, a slower speech rate, and occasional pauses in speech, all of which affect his overall communication ability.",
